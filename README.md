# Safe URL Checker (Streamlit App)

This application allows users to check the safety of a given URL using the VirusTotal API.  It aims to provide a quick way to assess potential risks associated with visiting a particular website, but it is important to note that results should not be the sole determinant in decision-making about site trust, and further investigation or consultation should be performed before taking action (based on output from this app or similar means).

## Features

* **Real-time URL safety assessment:** Input a URL, and receive a rapid analysis result.
* **Comprehensive information:** Provides a malicious/not malicious result, alongside more specific data regarding this type of security concerns and their risk to the user. The display includes both results from a safety perspective (likely safe or not) alongside specific numerical information associated with how unsafe an URL/site could be. 


## How to use

1. **Set up your environment:**  Ensure you have Python and the necessary packages installed.
2. **Install required packages:**


```bash
pip install streamlit requests


[secrets]
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key"


Enter a URL: https://www.example.com 

Safety Assessment: Likely Safe.
VirusTotal Data: {  (results from VirusTotal API, will vary) ...}




Remember to replace placeholders like `"your_app_name.py"` and `"your_actual_api_key"` with the correct filenames and your API key. This README provides a clear, comprehensive explanation suitable for a GitHub project.
